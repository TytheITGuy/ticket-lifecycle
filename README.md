<h1>osTicket - Ticket Lifecycle: Intake Through Resolution</h1>
This tutorial outlines the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />

This is a continuation of the [osTicket: Ticket Lifecycle Examples](https://github.com/TytheITGuy/ticket-lifecycle) project.
<br />


<h2>Environments and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>osTicket</b>

<h2>Project Walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
First, I will navigate to the end user site of osTicket to be able to create a new ticket: 

![1- Logging In](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02875e4c-1ac6-44a7-ad06-c5b606b038a5)

<p align="center">
I will open a new ticket and fill out the users information along with the technical issues:

Next, I will log in as an agent (worker) we created: 

![3- Logging in to user (worker)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf0817b0-872b-48bb-b345-887b07da638d)

<p align="center">
I can now see the open ticket I created in the "Tickets" tab: 

![4- Ticket Viewing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70d0276a-f474-4168-a58a-11633eb72399)

<p align="center">
When clicking on a ticket I can see all the information about the ticket like its priority, SLA, creation date, and more: 

![5- Opened Ticket](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0d97827-a126-42b0-9b06-8c8debe14202)

<p align="center">
I can change the priority level on appropriate tickets by clicking the "Priority" section and can add a note for the change made:  <br/>

![6- Updating Ticket Priority](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ef13acd-e701-468c-b175-0f5a6aefbd49)

<p align="center">
Looking further down I can see a thread of all of the changes made to the ticket:

![7- Ticket Thread](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b82f3fd-692d-4379-bfc1-22d65bae449e)

<p align="center">
To resolve a ticket, I can select "Resolved" from the "Ticket Status" menu at the bottom of the ticket:

![8- Resolving a Ticket](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c68a76e-2740-4fed-aff9-c4d9dea5d6a5)

<p align="center">
The resolved ticket will disappear from the open tickets tab and appear in the closed tickets tab:

![9- Ticket is gone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ebc408a-8b5a-4674-9a60-4d3fda14d26c)

<h2>osTicket: Creating and Working Tickets is now Complete!</h2>

<b> We've successfully gone through the life cycle of a ticket from creation to resolution. We made changes to the tickets when necessary like assigning the tickets and commenting to create a thread of clear communication! </b>
